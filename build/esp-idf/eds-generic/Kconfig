            Finite State Machine (FSM), may be executed by SMP.

            EPN callbacks are called on the following events:
            - when EPN wants to switch from idle state to run state.
            - when EPN wants to switch from run state to idle state
 
            The callbacks are passed to an EPN at the moment of the EPN instance creation.
