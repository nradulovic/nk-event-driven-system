 *

 * executed and he has the best view in order to decide on allocation algorithm. Whatever the
 * application writer decides to use (memory pools or heap) all it needs to do is to tell to

 *
 * This functions needs to be called before any other function from EDS package. The function will
 * store the information about available allocators. Allocators are used by create functions of EDS
 * when creating new objects. All objects used by EDS may be allocated dynamically or statically.
 * In order to create a static object use attribute structure `instance` pointer.
 *
 * If no allocators are provided EDS will not be able to create new objects and errors will be
 * returned.
 *
 * Specify for each allocator malloc/free pair how big memory partitions it can handle. This adds
 * ability to use multiple memory pools of different sizes.
 *
 * EDS can accept up to @ref EDS__DEFAULT_MEM_ENTRIES different allocators. It was shown in
 * practice that around 7 pool allocators of different sizes are needed for a typical application.
 *
 * @param       alloc is a pointer to function which allocates memory space. Allocator function
 *              receives the following arguments: first is the pointer to context structure, which
 *              was provided by @a context argument of this function; the second second argument
 *              tells to allocator function how big the memory block should be allocated. The size
 *              of this argument can be anything between zero and @a max_size argument of this
 *              function. The allocator function returns `void` pointer to allocated memory. If it
 *              can not allocate memory it returns NULL pointer. Allocator function does not need
 *              handle zero allocations (size of allocation is equal to zero).
 * @param       dealloc is a pointer to function which receives the context structure and the
 *              previously allocated block and it should recycle its space. This function does not
 *              need to handle NULL deallocations.
 * @param       context is pointer to allocator context structure if it needed by allocator. The
 *              structure needs to exist the whole time while allocator functions are being used.
 * @param       max_size is maximum size of block that can be allocated and freed by allocator. In
 *              case when a pool memory is used this argument will be equal to pool  memory block
 *              size. When this argument is set to zero or SIZE_MAX value then this allocator would
 *              be used in case no other allocator satisfies required size.
